            I am a full time student currently enrolled in Computer Science at 
            <span className="font-bold text-red-700 whitespace-nowrap"> UCalgary ðŸ¦–.</span>
            <br /><br />
            Choosing computer science was a difficult decision to make coming from a family full 
            of doctors where the only right path was medicine. But ever since I took my first 
            programming class, I was hooked. My main interests are software engineering, game development, 
            and virtual reality.
            <br /><br />
            Alongside this, I co-founded <a href="https://www.nullus.ca/" target="_blank" className="hover:underline">Nullus Inc.</a>, where we empower individuals, clubs, and companies through innovative web development solutions.
            <br /><br />
            Before, I was intimidated at the competitiveness of this field, but as Jim Carrey puts it:
            <br /><br />
          </p>
          <div className="xl:mx-4 xl:my-2 p-4 rounded-lg bg-[#141418] text-center">
            <p className="italic">
              &quot;You can fail at what you don&apos;t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love&quot;
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};
